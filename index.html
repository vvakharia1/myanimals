        The largest land mammal on earth, the African elephant weighs up to 
        eight tons. The elephant is distinguished by its massive body, large 
        ears and a long trunk, which has many uses ranging from using it as a 
        hand to pick up objects, as a horn to trumpet warnings, an arm raised 
        in greeting to a hose for drinking water or bathing.
